		What is Homebrew?

			Homebrew usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. Using the Homebrew Launcher will allow you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Running homebrew on your console is 100% free using nothing but the system's browser.

		What is CFW?

	<hr>
	
	<font size="+1">
		<p>
			Custom Firmware (CFW) enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do, in addition to anything homebrew can do.
			<br>
			This includes signature patching, which means that any title can be installed onto your Home Menu, such as the Homebrew Launcher, which allows for easy homebrew access
		</p>
		<p>
			CFW can be easily set up on any console in any region on the latest version.

			This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Wii U from stock firmware to Coldboot Haxchi powered Custom Firmware. It utilizes homebrew as a stepping off point, but Custom Firmware is still the goal.

		What can I do with Custom Firmware?

	<font size="+1">
		<li><b>Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Wii U hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. Theyíre rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.</b></li>
		<li>This guide will work on all Wii U devices in all regions on the version 5.5.0 to 5.5.2. (2.0.0 to 5.4.0 coming soon!)</li>
		<li>If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved).</li>
		<li>Your SD card is recommended to be at least 16GB or 32GB to have enough space for dumping and installing games.</li>
		<li>Your SD card should be <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/245610/">MBR, not GPT.</a></li>
		<li>If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can use <a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm">guiformat</a> and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 64K.</li>
