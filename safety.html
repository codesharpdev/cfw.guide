<h2>Vita Brick Safety</h2>
<p>Keep your Vita from blowing up</p>
	<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> perform file operations inside the <b>os0</b> partition. This may brick your device!</li>
	<li>Ensure that safe mode is turned on (accessable from "Settings > Henkaku Settings") when you are using your device.</li>
	<li>You need safe mode disabled for this guide though, make sure to keep it enabled while following it.</li>
	<li>Be careful when installing VPKs. Past dumps (such as Fruit Ninja and Lego Harry Potter) have had bricking applications injected into them, bricking your device</li>
