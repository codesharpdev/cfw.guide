The exploit will require you to relaunch the exploit on every reboot via the HENkaku website, but don’t worry, we’ll install a version which doesn’t require this later. Instructions Open the Web Browser on your PS Vita Go to https: henkaku.xyz go MolecularShell and HENkaku should now be installed on your Vita Enabling Unsafe Homebrew This will allow us to access the Vita’s internal memory and install homebrew which requires extended permissions. This can be dangerous and I recommend that beginners turn this off once they’re finished with the guide. Open the Settings application Select HENkaku Settings Check Enable Unsafe Homebrew Enabling downloads The Vita’s browser only lets us download certain types of files, such as audio and video files. Unfortunately, it won’t normally let us download Vita homebrew files, but with the Download Enabler plugin, we can download any file we want! Open the Web Browser on your PS Vita and navigate to this page Click the following link to download Download Enabler v3 onto your Vita Open MolecularShell and navigate to ux0:video XX Rename de3.mp4 to de3.suprx Press Triangle and copy the file Navigate to ur0:tai and paste it there Open config.txt and add the following text *main ur0:tai de3.suprx Exit and save changes Delete ux0:tai Reboot your console Installing Homebrew Now we’ve got that out the way, we can start to download some homebrew applications to put on our Home Menu Open the Web Browser on your PS Vita and navigate to this page Download the latest release of VitaShell Download the latest release of Vita Homebrew Browser Open MolecularShell and navigate to ux0:download Install both of the homebrew applications you just downloaded Make sure you still have unsafe homebrew enabled You can now use VitaShell as your main file browser, and use Vita Homebrew Browser to download whatever homebrew you want. Keep in mind that Unsafe Homebrew must be enabled to run Vita Homebrew Browser. Installing Ensō"
