<h2>Activating Vita</h2>
	<p>This will activate your Vita on 3.60 using MLTactivator</p>
	<p class="warning"><strong>WARNING!!! THIS METHOD IS VERY RISKY!!!</strong><br><b>USING ANY OFFICIAL PS VITA SERVER WILL <u>GET YOU BANNED</u></b></p>
	<p>When <a href="https://enso.henkaku.xyz/" target="_blank">HENkaku Ens≈ç</a> was released, Sony made a drastic change to how activating worked on the PS Vita. Because of this, many users found themselves unable to activate their Vitas on version 3.60. This meant that HENkaku users could no longer install Adrenaline.<br>Although <a href="https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW" target="_blank">TheFlow</a> has promised an upcoming version of Adrenaline which does not require activation, many users have been left without any Adrenaline installation in the meanwhile.<br>As of August 14th 2017, MLTactivator has been confirmed to work and activate Vitas offline and run Adrenaline.
<center><h1 class="warning"><a href="http://cfw.guide/">cfw.guide</a> will not be writing a guide for this, due to its riskiness.<h3>If you really want to go through with this, Google "MLTactivator" and install it yourself.<br>Remember that connecting to PSN Services will result in a <strong><u>BAN</u></strong></h3></h1></center>
