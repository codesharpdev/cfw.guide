Regular HENkaku requires us to relaunch the exploit upon every reboot. This might not be hard, but it can get annoying. This is why we recommend installing Ensō. 
HENkaku Ensō will automatically install HENkaku on boot, making it the best solution to PS Vita homebrew right now.

## Instructions

1. Open the Web Browser on your PS Vita and navigate to this page
2. Click the following link to download [HENkaku Ensō](https://github.com/henkaku/enso/releases/download/v1.0/enso.vpk) onto your Vita
3. Open VitaShell and navigate to `ux0:download`
4. Install `enso.vpk`
5. Exit back to the home menu and open the Ensō application
6. Press **O** to accept terms
7. Press **X** to install Ensō
* If it says os0 modifications detected, press X to install the 3.60 PUP

You're done!
