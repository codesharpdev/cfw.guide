Unforunately, you can only run HENkaku on version 3.60. Fortunately for us who are below that version, there's now a super easy method which allows us to update without going to the latest version.

## Instructions

1. Open the Settings application
2. Select **Network > Wi-Fi Settings > Advanced Settings > DNS Settings**
* Make sure you are connected to the internet
* Make sure **Proxy Server** is set to **Do Not Use**
3. Choose **Manual**
4. Change your **Primary DNS** to `212.47.229.76`
* Leave your Secondary DNS blank
5. Go back to the main Settings screen and select **System Update > Update Using Wi-Fi**
6. **Be absolutely certain that the message says *"3.60 (変革 Compatible)"***
7. Update your system to 3.60
