## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) are games and other software not officially approved. For example, VitaDoom is a port of the classic game DOOM and mGBA lets you play Game Boy Advance ROMs. You can find more examples [here](https://henkaku.xyz/showcase/).

## What is HENkaku?

[**HENkaku**](https://henkaku.xyz/) is the first ever homebrew enabler for PS Vita and PSTV. It is akin to jailbreaking your iPhone or rooting your Android device.

Running homebrew on your Vita is 100% free using [HENkaku](https://henkaku.xyz/). No cost, no ads, and no "donations". As long as you're on version 3.60 or below, you're good to go! If you paid for this software, you should ask for your money back.

## What is Ensō?

**Ensō** enables HENkaku to be installed automatically on boot. HENkaku requires you to reinstall it upon every reboot, however Ensō fixes this.

## What does this guide install?

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Vita from stock firmware to HENkaku Ensō.

## What can I do with Custom Firmware?

+ Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes
+ Backup, edit, and restore saves for your games games
+ Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
+ Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your HOME Menu
+ Dump your game cards to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card
+ Use an SD Card instead of Sony's expensive propriety memory cards
+ Use a USB memory stick or a USB hard drive instead of Sony's memory cards (PSTV only)

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Ensō: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility. Installing Ensō may make your device PERMANENTLY UNUSABLE.**
+ It most likely won't happen though.
+ This guide will work on both Vita 1000 and Vita 2000 in all regions on firmware 3.60 or below.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ **Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!**
+ You must have a memory card if you are using a Vita 1000 (Fat Version) (OLED Display)
